# EEGNet-with-LOSO-Pre-training-and-Progressive-Fine-Tuning
This repository implements EEGNet with Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation combined with subject-specific fine-tuning for motor imagery EEG classification. The pipeline demonstrates how minimal calibration data (~1 session, ~144 trials) can significantly improve generic population-level models
